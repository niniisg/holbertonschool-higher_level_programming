Python-Server-Side Rendering


This project focuses on server-side rendering (SSR), where web pages are generated on the server and delivered as complete HTML to the client, unlike client-side rendering that relies on the browser and JavaScript. You'll learn to implement SSR using Python and Flask, utilizing the Jinja templating engine to build dynamic, efficient, and SEO-friendly web applications.
