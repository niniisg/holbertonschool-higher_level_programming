### Python Project: Understanding Objects

#### Overview

In this project, you'll deepen your understanding of how Python handles objects by exploring its specific behaviors. This exercise is different from typical projects; it focuses on theoretical questions about Python's object model. 

#### Objectives

- **Explore Python's Object Model**: Understand how Python treats variables and objects, including the nuances of object assignment and mutation.
- **Question-Based Learning**: The project is designed around theoretical questions such as “What would be the result of…”. The goal is to think critically and understand the underlying principles before testing in the Python interpreter.

#### Key Points

- **Variable Assignment**: Learn how changes to variables affect objects, especially with mutable types like lists.
- **Documentation and Brainstorming**: Start by thoroughly reading the documentation and brainstorming answers. Avoid immediate experimentation in the interpreter to ensure a deeper understanding.
- **Interview Preparation**: The knowledge gained will be valuable for Python interviews, where similar questions about object behavior are common.

#### Instructions

1. **Read the Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with Python’s object model.
2. **Think and Brainstorm**: Reflect on the questions without coding initially.
3. **Test in Interpreter**: Use the Python interpreter only after you’ve thought through the questions to validate your understanding.
