Python RESTful API

Introduction:

This project explores RESTful APIs, essential for efficient data communication between systems.
REST architecture ensures scalability, statelessness, and cacheability,
enabling seamless integration of web services across various applications


Learning Objectives:

HTTP/HTTPS Basics: Grasp the foundational principles of the web’s primary protocol, understanding how data transfer occurs,
methods involved, and the difference between the secure and non-secure versions.

API Consumption with Command Line: Hands-on experience in interacting with APIs using basic command-line tools,
laying the groundwork for more advanced interactions.

API Consumption with Python: Elevate your data fetching skills by leveraging Python’s capabilities,
allowing for more advanced processing and data manipulation.

API Development with http.server: Understand the basics of crafting an API from scratch using Python’s built-in modules,
setting a solid foundation.

API Development with Flask: Dive deeper into API development using the lightweight Flask framework, 
focusing on routing, data management, and scalability.

API Security & Authentication: Address the crucial aspect of security,
understanding how to protect data transfer and ensure only authorized access to resources.

API Standards & Documentation with OpenAPI: Conclude with the importance of maintaining standardized documentation,
ensuring that APIs are usable, understandable, and maintainable

Importance

RESTful APIs are crucial for integrating diverse systems.
They act as intermediaries, translating requests,fetching data, and facilitating processes.
From social media platforms exchanging data with advertisers to intricate industrial systems enabling automation,
APIs are omnipresent.Mastering API consumption, development, security, and documentation provides a vital skill set.
It entails grasping technical details and overarching design principles, ensuring smooth and efficient
